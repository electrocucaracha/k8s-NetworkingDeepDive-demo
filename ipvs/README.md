# IP Virtual Server

IPVS (IP Virtual Server) implements transport-layer load balancing, usually
called Layer 4 LAN switching, as part of the Linux kernel. IPVS running on a
host acts as a load balancer at the front of a cluster of real servers, it can
direct requests for TCP/UDP based services to the real servers, and makes
services of the real servers to appear as a virtual service on a single IP
address.

The scripts of this folder compares two scheduling algorithms supported by IPVS

- Round Robin - Distributes jobs equally amongst the available real server
- Weighted Round Robin - Assigns jobs to real servers proportionally to there
real serversâ€™ weight. Servers with higher weights receive new jobs first and get
more jobs than servers with lower weights. Servers with equal weights get an
equal distribution of new jobs.

## Demo output example

The following output was capture from the _deploy.log_ file generated
from the `vagrant up` execution.
